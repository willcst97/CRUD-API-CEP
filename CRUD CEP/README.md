<h3>Running the Project Locally</h3>
  <p>To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. <b>Clone the Repository</b>: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone <repository_url>

2. <b>Navigate to Project Directory</b>: Move into the project directory:

   cd <project_directory>

3. <b>Install Dependencies</b>: Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

   npm install

   or

   yarn

4. <b>Setup Environment Variables</b>: Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the variables given in `.env.sample`

5. <b>Start the Development Server</b>: Run the following command to start the development server:

   npm start

6. <b>Access the App</b>: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for frontend `http://localhost:5000` to access the app. You can now use the app locally on your machine, connected to your MySQL database using the variables specified in the `.env` file.
